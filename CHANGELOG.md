# FavorCraft — Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.5.2-beta — 2026-11-08

- Filter choices are now stored independently for each profession and restored when switching professions or reopening FavorCraft. First-visit automatic defaults for broad professions and the existing All Specs behavior for Enchanting, Engineering, and Cooking are preserved; Alchemy retains its existing behavior.

## 0.5.1-beta — 2026-11-04

- Recipe details now follow the selected profession and active filters. Empty results clear the details pane without losing saved purchase plans.
- Recipe comparison research now excludes other Merchant's Favor items, so the panel focuses on alternatives acquired outside the Favor system.
- Blacksmithing comparisons now show four level-appropriate, rare-quality crafted alternatives rather than unrelated lower-tier same-slot gear. Other recipes show no comparison when no suitable alternative is documented.
- The Learned/Unlearned indicators remain a green check and red X. Recipes not yet detected as learned show Unlearned, including before a profession scan.
- Reviewed the 32 additional recipe-acquisition reports (15 Blacksmithing, 17 Leatherworking). Dungeon and world drops are labeled as reports, trainer disputes remain visible, and those sources stay separate from crafted-item comparisons.
- Improved regression checks and verified the runtime file lists in both Forever TOCs. Source reports and visual behavior still require in-game verification.

## 0.5.0-beta — 2026-10-16

- Recipe and material names load ahead of time and stay saved, so item numbers no longer flash in.
- Materials list every reagent. Materials and recipe comparisons scroll together.
- All classes shows all 309 recipes, including the three Paladin enchanting relics.
- Enchanting and Engineering comparisons use researched alternatives with native tooltips.
- A recipe with no comparison just says None.
- Some Blacksmithing plans and Leatherworking patterns list another reported place to get the same recipe.
- Weak same-slot trainer gear is no longer compared with Favor pieces of a different quality or level.

## 0.4.9-beta — 2026-10-16

- Cooking, Enchanting, and Engineering check All specs when you open them. The spec you saved stays underneath.

## 0.4.8-beta — 2026-10-16

- Cooking, Enchanting, and Engineering check All specs when you open them. The spec you saved stays underneath.

## 0.4.7-beta — 2026-10-16

- A learned recipe shows a green check. A recipe this character has not learned shows a red x.
- Tank, DPS, and Healer include utility recipes. All specs checks all three, and My spec keeps the boxes you set. Opening the window returns to All specs.
- All classes stays on until you choose My class. That choice is saved. Alchemy, Cooking, Enchanting, and Engineering switch back to All classes.
- Hunters and paladins see caster Alchemy while DPS is checked.
- The profession list groups Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Tailoring, then Enchanting, Engineering, and Alchemy, then Cooking.
- Blacksmithing and Cooking comparisons can show the crafted item.
- Comparisons sit at the bottom of the recipe, wrap inside the panel, and list where an item comes from plus the similarities and differences that were found.
- Elixir of Wisdom is listed first as an almost identical item. The separate trainer note is gone.

## 0.4.2-beta — 2026-10-16

- CurseForge beta packaging. Gameplay is unchanged from 0.4.1-beta.

## 0.4.1-beta — 2026-10-16

- Profession skill numbers turn green when your skill is high enough and red when it is not.
- Needed counts turn green when your bags cover them and red when they do not. In Bags stays white, and a dash means you are not carrying that material.
- Recipe details list the name, profession skill, required level, and pattern, then the materials.
- The favor total for the recipes you selected sits under the Favor column.
- Recipe details can show a comparison when another recipe or item is known.
- Some Leatherworking patterns also list a reported place to learn the same pattern. Those reports stay unverified.
- Settings credits list Babunigaming and Danoozy.

## 0.3.0-beta — 2026-10-15

- FavorCraft plans Merchant's Favor recipe purchases and the materials those crafts need.
- Alliance and Horde share one recipe list. Armor follows the class filter, including paladin plate.

## Documentation audit #35 — 2026-10-28

- Created visual-design, content/provenance and human–AI collaboration guides.
- Expanded historical and technical documentation, preserving co-originator Danoozy's original idea and Babuni.dev's implementation/refinement credit.
- Clarified the 309 recipes / 314 offers distinction and the legacy data/command continuity. No Lua, add-on metadata, data catalog or packaging source was modified; no runtime test was executed.

## 2026-11-13 — License and rights

- Established MIT for original addon software, preserving Danoozy's credit and updated repository documentation to explain the permission boundary.
- Preserved third-party authorship and external assets' separate terms. No gameplay or runtime verification is claimed.
